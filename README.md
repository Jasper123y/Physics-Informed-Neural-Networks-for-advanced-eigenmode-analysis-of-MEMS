# Physics-Informed-Neural-Networks-for-advanced-eigenmode-analysis-of-MEMS
We present and validate a PINNs-based framework for MEMS eigenmode analysis. It models multiple vibration modes in arbitrary geometries, validated via DHM on a PMUT device, and enables fast PMUT array evaluation by combining PINNs with analytical models.
